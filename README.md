# TU Buddy

TU Buddy is a web application designed to complement the mobile application being developed for the CN333 Mobile Application Development course. This project provides a unified platform for Thammasat University students to connect, share, and engage in a vibrant campus community. 🎓💻

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 🚀
- **Database ORM:** [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) 🗄️
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Future support for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)) 🛠️

## Authentication (Future Feature)

The integration with **TU API** for authentication is an essential feature planned for future development. Currently, this feature is not implemented because it requires permission from the university. Once approval is obtained, students will be able to log in securely using their Thammasat University credentials, ensuring only authorized users can access the platform. 🔐

This feature will be added as soon as the necessary permissions are granted.

## Features

### 1. **Marketplace** 💰

- Students can sell and buy second-hand items. 🛒

### Contributions

This project is created as a personal initiative to complement the mobile app developed for the CN333 Mobile Application Development course. The course focuses on mobile app development, but I decided to build a web platform on my own for personal learning purposes. This project is not a requirement for the course and has been developed independently. ✨
