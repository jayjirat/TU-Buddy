### Contributions

This project is created as a personal initiative to complement the mobile app developed for the CN333 Mobile Application Development course. The course focuses on mobile app development, but I decided to build a web platform on my own for personal learning purposes. This project is not a requirement for the course and has been developed independently. ✨
